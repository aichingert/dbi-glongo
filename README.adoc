= Space

this should be a physics simulation that shows the space curvature caused from planets
( this is also a 2d simplification because you cannot show it in the 3 dimensional space )

== TODOS

* Implement grid mesh so you can see space
* Implement the ability to "throw" planets into the net
* Show the curvature caused of the planets
