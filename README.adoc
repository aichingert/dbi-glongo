Mongodb example project with a gtk frontend using the mongo-c-driver

== Information

The way to get the value of text from bson_iter is very weird. If someone knows how to do it better feel free to open a pull request and let me know. Currently I am doing it this way.

[source, c]
----
value = bson_iter_value(&iter);

if (value->value_type == 2) {
	printf("%s\n", (char*)value->value.v_utf8.str);
}
----

== How to run

[source, sh]
----
make
----

If make fails then you have to install the gtk and mongo-c-driver libraries for c.
